I've always had an interest in coding, when I was younger it was mostly all hex editing or memory value editing in social online games. I signed up on online forums and realized quickly there were far better ways to hook into my favorite games and sometimes provide an unfair advantage. This interest of breaking the game led me to Visual Basic 6. I made very beginner applications trying to get a grasp of it all. I then learned a small amount of PHP and HTML because I needed a website to host all of the applications I made, but as time went on life of course, as it does leads you to different directions. I missed the challenge of debugging the same code 200 times and googling the other 200 times trying to fix an error. This may sound like the worst and sometimes it absolutely was, but the feeling of reward and accomplishment after it was said and done made it all worth it! The community around coding with likeminded individuals all working to finish the same goal or task made it a very rewarding experience.
I'm excited to get back into coding and I'm looking forward to learning with everyone.
